# Cadenza

 Backend Final Project Fall 2020
 
 This is the backend for Cadenza, an app that allows users to request and make song recommendations from their friends. Users can also favorite songs for themselves.
 
 In the relational database schema for our backend, we have association tables for: users and songs, songs and recommendations, and users and users (to allow for friending). So, users can favorite their top songs, recommend songs in response to their friends' requests, and friend other users.

Cadenza uses the iTunes Search API in order to allow user to search for songs that they favorite, or recommend to their friends.
