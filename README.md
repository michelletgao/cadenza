# Cadenza
 **by Michelle Gao and Arianna Curillo**
 
 Backend Final Project Fall 2020
 
 This is the backend for Cadenza, an app that allows users to request and make song recommendations from their friends. 
 
 In our relational database schema for our backend we have association tables for: users and songs; songs and recommendations; and friends(following and followers).

 We used the iTunes API for users to search songs that they can favorite and give as recommendations.
